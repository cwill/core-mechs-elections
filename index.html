Hello, my name is Loading. I would like to become your core rep. I have been around for a while and spend a good chunk of time on the server interacting with our team as well as others. I generally like to be up to date on projects we have going on and would love to be able to help in any way I can and if becoming a rep helps me help other people have a generally more positive experience that would be wonderful.

I would not make a good representative and I do not want to be one.  How did I even end up on this list?

Hey folks,
I'm NF211. You may know me from such things as &quot;terrible bee wedding puns&quot; or &quot;the mech's backup backup backup artist&quot; and &quot;NF's talking about philosophy again.&quot; As some of y'all know I've been touring around the league asking folks what makes their teams tick, and one big takeaway I've found is that the Mechs are pretty unique. In a short time we've attracted a wild riot of players from across a huge range of backgrounds, interests, skill sets, and even continents. We're bound together by our mutual joy in one another's passions, and we find genuine strength in our diversity. We're now stewards of some of the league's most famous players, and we're writing sagas all our own as well. I want to step up as a rep because I think the way we learn and keep learning to work with one another is something unique in all of Blaseball, and I want to do my part in bringing that spirit into the future of the league.<br>
Thanks for readin'!

<b>EsotericTriangle (Triangle#6405)</b>
<p>
Hello! I'm the one who makes polls/manages the vote recording form. I like to see things run smoothly and try to facilitate what I can to make what people want to happen actually happen, which is what got me started down the spreadsheet trail originally. In general, I don't super enjoy the spotlight; I'd rather work in engineering than on the bridge or whatever, so the whole brightly colored safety vest makes me a lil nervous. But I also feel like I can help and organize things and encourage all of us Core Fans do our Thing better (plus, I'm online at least in some form for much of most days). idk, I like to help, and I think I can do a good job wearing a &#x1F9BA;.

The Core Mechanics are my home. They were since the day they dropped and I got stars in my eyes. So I wanna put work in the community. I've tried to be a positive influence for the team with the stories I tell on twitter and the way I've interacted with everyone these last few months. For years previously I would facilitate large group discussions and have worked through many of the common issues presented with a wide variety of people talking with each other. I'm also training in a very collaborative creative field where devaluing anyoneâ€™s opinion ends in failed products. I feel like I have the more then enough experience to help the Mechs and will continue to do so with or without this position.

I want to be a rep because this community has been so great to me and I would love a chance to give back to it. I have always had a tendency to gravitate towards leadership/moderator roles in communities I have been a part of because there is nothing I enjoy more than seeing the people around me happy and being part of the reason why those people are happy. As a rep I promise that I will dedicate myself to ensuring that everyone in this great community has the best time possible, whether that be through lore jams, stat talks, or cross-team game parties. I love you guys and I can't wait to help out in any way that I can!

<p>
Hey all! I'm Sharkbait! I've been with the Mechs since our first season &amp; if you've been on Discord you've most likely seen me cheering for the team at unreasonably late hours.<br>
I love this team a lot &amp; I'm active enough on Discord that I can absolutely help facilitate productive (and peaceful) discussions and reach out to other teams for whatever events we want to organize. I adore this community &amp; I hope to help all of you keep it running smoothly and efficiently. Thanks!

Hi, I'm Rae, and despite having only been following blaseball since season 15, I'd love to be a rep. I love the Core Mechanics community, and interacting with everyone in the discord has been a highlight of the past couple of weeks, especially the lore brainstorms. I would take the responsibility if being a rep seriously, and believe I'd be a good person for the role.

I was a temp captain for the Mechs back in the dawn of time, but didn't sign up for the first round of elections because I wasn't sure I'd have enough time to do it properly. Since then, I've built a website for the team, calculated tonnes of election probabilities and designed more than a few gearballs for the party. As it turns out (1) I do have enough time for this actually, and (2) I reckon I'd do a pretty OK job of it!

Hey! We're Sans! You've seen us around under our various selves:<br>
Mechanic MF, Gardner Swozi, Holly, &amp; Cee, who all use the System tag Sarifs. (get it? sans sarifs? sorry, i'm still proud of that one.)<br><br>
We're big fans of the Mechanics, and have been here since pretty close to the beginning! We took a small break recently, but we're really committed to this team, and have a deep love of it! We currently run 1 blaseball twitter RP account (@JasB_CORE), and just have a deep love of the omnipunk feel of the Mechanics. As for why you should vote for us specifically? We've got strong ties with other teams due to existing friendships and previous volunteering on other teams (such as helping run game nights on the flowers) and just a deep love of working with others! We're really passionate people, and would love the chance to translate our passion into the Mechanics!<br>

Hello all! I'm dave(s) (and some others), you may know me as "That guy who really likes Jolene Willowtree" or "That guy that has too many gearballs". And I'm both of those! But I'm also a mech at heart, I love this community and the great vibes we've built up. Striving to reflect the values of the Core in the fan community, supporting each other, helping with projects and sometimes just talking about something ya really like for a couple hours with people who like it too!! I'd like to be able to support that community in a bigger way! Whether that is helping new people find their way around, plugging democracy, or making some graphics for whatever new shenanigan the mechs find themselves in.<br>
And okay I'll admit i'm a goofball most of the time but I can be serious when necessary, and I think I wouldn't be half bad as a rep if given the chance! Thank you for your time and good luck to everyone!

I want to be a rep because I love this team and I have been looking for a way of giving back and doing something more for the community. I have been a fan of the Mechs since it first came through the Breach, participating in the initial lore development and supporting new ideas ever since. You many also know me as one of the more avid "We All Lift Together" chanters. What I bring to the rep role is a combination of organization skill (I'm a librarian IRL -- which further explains why I'm drawn to BACK), supportive leadership (playing to people's strengths), and what I think is a healthy mix of emotional investment and detachment when it comes to the team and to Blaseball (ie. I will be sad when we lose games or team members, but I'm also generally someone who'll keep a level head during these times as well). So vote for me, your favourite Z-List Space MacGuffin! Duct Tape is part of our aesthetic!
